# This is a Gitpod configuration file, which defines tasks that Gitpod will automatically run when this repository is opened in a Gitpod workspace.

# The 'tasks' section defines a list of tasks that can be run in the workspace.

# The first task in the list is 'init', which is run automatically when the workspace is created.

# The 'init' task installs any Python dependencies that are listed in the 'requirements.txt' file, which is typically located in the root directory of the repository.

# This is useful for ensuring that all necessary dependencies are installed and available in the workspace, so that the code can be run and tested without any issues.

# By including this task in the Gitpod configuration file, users can save time and effort by avoiding the need to manually install dependencies every time they open a new workspace.
